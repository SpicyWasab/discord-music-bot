# Here's a little open source discord music bot
After the shutdown of Rhythm and Groovy, we needed a new bot to play music, and there wasn't really good options out there.
I spent a week during my vacations to make a bot for my friends and I, in order to listen to music while we play Overwatch c:

It really is a simple bot, but manages to play, pause, queue, and display the lyrics (I mean for the lyrics part it's only if you're lucky enough and it's not yet broken when you read this x))
