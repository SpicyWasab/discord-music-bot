# Here's a little open source discord music bot
After the shutdown of Rhythm and Groovy, we needed a new bot to play music, and there wasn't really good options out there.
I spent a week during my vacations to make a bot for my friends and I, in order to listen to music while we play Overwatch c:

It really is a simple bot, but manages to play, pause, queue, and there was a command to display the lyrics (but it was buggy so it never made it to the repo)
